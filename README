2. Purpose

The aim of this distribution is to provide comprehensive and flexible
tools to analyze codon usage bias (CUB) and relevant problems.

One amino acid can be encoded by more than one synonymous codon, and
synonymous codons are unevenly used. For example, some codons are used
more often than other synonymous ones in highly expressed genes
(I<Sharp and Li 1987>). To measure the unevenness of codon usage, multiple
indices of codon usage bias have been developed, such as Fop
(Frequency of optimal codons), CAI (Codon Adaptation Index), tAI (tRNA
Adaptation Index), and ENC (Effective Number of Codons). The causes of
CUB phenomena are complicated, including, mutational bias, selection
on translational efficiency or accurancy. CUB is one fundamental concept
in genetics.

So far, no software exists to compute all the above CUB indices, and
worse is that parameters of CUB calculations are often fixed in
software, so one can only analyze genes in a limited list of species
and one can not incorporate its own parameters such as sequences of
highly expressed genes in a tissue.

This package mainly solves these two problems. We also extend some
methods, such as GC-content corrected ENC, background-data normalized
CAI, etc. See the relevant methods in CUB classes for more details.
