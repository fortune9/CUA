        1. Update Tutorial.pod by correcting format errors and reword
        sentences.
		2. Change program names as follows:
		   build_cai_param.pl -> cai_codon.pl
		   build_tai_param.pl -> tai_codon.pl
		   calculate_CUB.pl   -> cub_seq.pl
		The new names reflect the functions of the programs better.

		'bin' directory.
		3. Add a tutorial file Tutorial.pod.

1.02    Sat May 16 23:04:25 EDT 2015
        Use a perl module t/env.pm to set environment variables during
		installation test, replacing the original way of setting
		environment variables using 'export' in makefile, because the
		latter does not work for NetBSD/FreeBSD/Windows systems
