# CUA
A software package for Codon Usage Analyses

This is a software package designed to analyse codon usage in protein-coding sequences. The usage of codons often varies for gene to gene and from organism to organism. To measure the variation, different parameters have been developed. The most often used codon usage bias parameters are as follows:
1. CAI: Codon Adaptation Index
2. Fop: Frequency of optimal codons
3. tAI: tRNA Adaptation Index
4. ENC: Effective Number of Codons.

In addition to implementing all the parameters in this package, the most value feature of this package is its flexibility in specifying user-specific parameters such as the list of optimal codons, the abundance of tRNAs, genetic codon table, etc.
